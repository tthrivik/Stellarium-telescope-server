Compilation:

Linux + g++:
  just 'make', optionally: 'make depend'.
  You will get TelescopeServerDummy and TelescopeServerLx200

Solaris,BSD,Hpux,...
  should be similas to Linux, perhaps slight modification required.
  Help is welcome.

WIN32 + mingw-g++-crosscompiler:
  optionally: 'make depend' as above,
  export the path to your crosscompiler like
  'export CROSS_GPP=/usr/local/mingw/i386-mingw32/bin/g++',
  then 'make exe'.
  You will get TelescopeServerDummy.exe and TelescopeServerLx200.exe

---------------------
Usage examples:

> TelescopeServerDummy 10000
starts the dummy server listening on port 10000

> TelescopeServerLx200 10001 /dev/ttyS0
starts the Lx200 server listening on port 10001 and controlling
the Meade Lx200 telescope on /dev/ttyS0

---------------------

Other telescopes:

Any developer who wants to extend this library for using of his
telescope is welcome. Escpecially interresting would be the integration
of this library and of existing telescope libraries (indi,ascom,whatever)
in order to produce general purpose telescope server programs.

Or you could easily build your own telescope server program entirely
from scratch and take this library just as an example and a proof of concept
for the stellarium TCP telescope protocol.

GENERATING DOCUMENTATION
========================

A documentation can be autmatically generated with Doxygen.

Just run
> doxygen Doxyfile
in the main directory. The output files will be generated in the /doc directory.
The default output format is HTML, so the starting point is /doc/html/index.html
Different formats and other options can be set by editing /Doxyfile.
